Apps created as homework for iOS LevelUp classes in 2019

## About
In early 2019, I have taken part in iOS LevelUp classes organized by Daftcode ([github repo](https://github.com/DaftMobile/ioslevelup_spring2019)). These classes have been about a number of topics, such as:

* gestures and animations
* dealing with UIScrollView
* Collections and Layouts
* Unit Testing
* reactive programming in Swift

This repository contains homework projects created for these classes.
